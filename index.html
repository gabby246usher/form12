          <p>
            Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has
            efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective
            approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and
            dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an
            ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in
            many areas on most platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely
            available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the
            Python web site,
            <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a>, and
            may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions
            of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs
            and tools, and additional documentation.
          </p>

          <p>
            This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts
            and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a
            Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples
            are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
          </p>
          <li>
            When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in
            interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with
            the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for
            continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default
            three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating
            its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first
            prompt:
          </li>
          <code
            >python3.14 Python 3.14 (default, April 4 2024, 09:25:04) [GCC
            10.2.0] on linux Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
            for more information. >>></code
          >
          <p>
            Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct.
            As an example, take a look at this if statement:
          </p>
          <code
            >the_world_is_flat = True >>> if the_world_is_flat: ... print("Be
            careful not to fall off!") ... Be careful not to fall off!</code

        <section id="Python-Calculator" class="main-section">
          <header>Using Python as a Calculator</header>
          <p>
            Let’s try some simple Python commands. Start the interpreter and
            wait for the primary prompt, >>>. (It shouldn’t take long.)
          </p>
          <li>Numbers</li>
          <p>
            The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an
            expression at it and it will write the value. Expression syntax is
            straightforward: the operators +, -, * and / can be used to perform
            arithmetic; parentheses (()) can be used for grouping. For example:
          </p>

          <code
            >2 + 2 4 >>> 50 - 5*6 20 >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4 5.0 >>> 8 / 5 # division
            always returns a floating-point number 1.6</code
          >
          <p>
            The integer numbers (e.g. 2, 4, 20) have type int, the ones with a
            fractional part (e.g. 5.0, 1.6) have type float. We will see more
            about numeric types later in the tutorial.
          </p>
          <p>
            Division (/) always returns a float. To do floor division and get an
            integer result you can use the // operator; to calculate the
            remainder you can use %:
          </p>
          <code
            >>>>>17 / 3 # classic division returns a float 5.666666666666667 >>>
            17 // 3 # floor division discards the fractional part 5 >>> 17 % 3 #
            the % operator returns the remainder of the division 2 >>> 5 * 3 + 2
            # floored quotient * divisor + remainder 17</code
          >
          <li>Text</li>
          <p>
            Python can manipulate text (represented by type str, so-called
            “strings”) as well as numbers. This includes characters “!”, words
            “rabbit”, names “Paris”, sentences “Got your back.”, etc. “Yay! :)”.
            They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes
            ("...") with the same result [2].
          </p>

          <code
            >'spam eggs' # single quotes 'spam eggs' "Paris rabbit got your back
            :)! Yay!" # double quotes 'Paris rabbit got your back :)! Yay!'
            '1975' # digits and numerals enclosed in quotes are also strings
            '1975'
          </code>
        </section>

        <section id="if-statements" class="main-section">
          <header>if Statements</header>
          <p>
            Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For
            example:
          </p>
          <code
            >x = int(input("Please enter an integer: ")) Please enter an
            integer: 42 >>> if x < 0: ... x = 0 ... print('Negative changed to
            zero') ... elif x == 0: ... print('Zero') ... elif x == 1: ...
            print('Single') ... else: ... print('More') ... More</code
          >
          <li>
            There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional.
            The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid
            excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a
            substitute for the switch or case statements found in other
            languages.
          </li>
          <p>
            If you’re comparing the same value to several constants, or checking
            for specific types or attributes, you may also find the match
            statement useful. For more details see match Statements.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="for-statements" class="main-section">
          <header>For Statements</header>
          <p>
            The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used
            to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic
            progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the
            ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as
            C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence
            (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.
            For example (no pun intended):
          </p>
          <code
            ># Measure some strings: >>> words = ['cat', 'window',
            'defenestrate'] >>> for w in words: ... print(w, len(w)) ... cat 3
            window 6 defenestrate 12</code
          >
          <li>
            Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same
            collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more
            straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create
            a new collection:
          </li>
          <code
            ># Create a sample collection users = {'Hans': 'active', 'Éléonore':
            'inactive', '景太郎': 'active'} # Strategy: Iterate over a copy for
            user, status in users.copy().items(): if status == 'inactive': del
            users[user] # Strategy: Create a new collection active_users = {}
            for user, status in users.items(): if status == 'active':
            active_users[user] = status</code
          >
        </section>

        <section id="range-function" class="main-section">
          <header>The range() Function</header>
          <p>
            If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in
            function range() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic
            progressions:
          </p>
          <code>for i in range(5): print(i) output: 0 1 2 3 4</code>
          <li>
            The given end point is never part of the generated sequence;
            range(10) generates 10 values, the legal indices for items of a
            sequence of length 10. It is possible to let the range start at
            another number, or to specify a different increment (even negative;
            sometimes this is called the ‘step’):
          </li>
          <code
            >list(range(5, 10)) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] list(range(0, 10, 3)) [0, 3, 6,
            9] list(range(-10, -100, -30)) [-10, -40, -70]</code
